<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-arch-linux-">What is Arch Linux?</h2>
<p>Arch Linux is an independently-developed rolling-release distribution of Linux. This means that there are no major updates that are delivered to Arch, unlike Windows. Instead, Arch delivers updates in small, frequent amounts, meaning that you have access to the latest drivers, firmware and software as soon as it&#39;s available. Since Arch is based off the Linux kernel, it&#39;s distributed under the GNU GPLv2 license, meaning that anyone can view the kernel, and what makes up Arch, as well as being able to modify it any point, so long as the software remains open-source.</p>
<p>Arch Linux is fantastic for its Arch User Repository (AUR) and simplicity of design. It is well known for its straightforwardness and is relatively easy for the end user to understand directly, rather than having to dig through multiple layers of graphical interfaces. The package manager - pacman - has no GUI, meaning that everything has to be installed through the command line. This may seem a bit scary at first, but in this guide, I will go through how to install Arch Linux, and how to use its many features.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="booting-into-the-archiso-a-name-boot-to-archiso-a-">Booting into the ArchISO <a name="boot-to-archiso"></a></h1>
<h2 id="creating-the-arch-installation-medium-a-name-creating-boot-medium-a-">Creating the Arch installation medium <a name="creating-boot-medium"></a></h2>
<p>Firstly, get the ISO file from <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">the official Arch Linux website</a> or <a href="https://www.archlinux32.org/download/">the website for the community-maintained 32-bit Arch Linux OS</a> either through torrenting it, or using one of the mirrorlinks.\
You&#39;ll need to use software such as <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html">Ventoy</a>, <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">Rufus</a> or <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher">BalenaEtcher</a>. The instructions on how to use such software can be found within their websites.</p>
<h2 id="entering-the-boot-menu-a-name-entering-boot-menu-a-">Entering the boot menu <a name="entering-boot-menu"></a></h2>
<p>Once the ISO has been written to a storage medium (that could be a USB thumb drive, SD card .etc), you&#39;ll need to go into your computers boot options through the firmware interface. To do so, follow the instructions below, based on your current operating system (not the operating system you want to install, which is, obviously, Arch Linux).</p>
<details>
 <summary><h3>Windows</h3></summary>


 On Windows systems, open up the command prompt by hitting the Win and searching <code>cmd</code>.\
 Make sure you run it as an administrator.\
 Once you&#39;ve done that, enter the following command:
 <code>shutdown /r /fw /t 0</code>

 And enter your computer&#39;s boot menu. Once that&#39;s done, select the storage medium that contains your ArchISO.\
 Then, wait for it to boot before selecting the option containing <code>Arch Linux install medium</code> or <code>Arch Linux install medium (with speech)</code> if you are visually impaired, and have someone reading this guide to you out loud.
</details>

<details>
 <summary><h3>MacOS</h3></summary>


 On a MacOS system, there is no way through the command line to enter the boot menu.\
 You can only do so by powering off the system entirely and holding the <code>Alt</code> or <code>Option</code> key when powering it on.\
 Select the storage medium that contains your ArchISO.\
 Then, wait for it to boot before selecting the option containing <code>Arch Linux install medium</code> or <code>Arch Linux install medium (with speech)</code> if you are visually impaired, and have someone reading this guide to you out loud.
</details>

<details>
 <summary><h3>Linux</h3></summary>

 Assuming you have SystemD installed on your system, run the below command:
 <code>sudo systemctl reboot --firmware-setup</code>

 And enter your computer&#39;s boot menu. Once that&#39;s done, select the storage medium that contains your ArchISO.\
 Then, wait for it to boot before selecting the option containing <code>Arch Linux install medium</code> or <code>Arch Linux install medium (with speech)</code> if you are visually impaired, and have someone reading this guide to you out loud.
</details>

<hr>
<h2 id="pre-installation-configuration">Pre-installation configuration</h2>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve booted into the ArchISO, you need to run some commands before installing Arch to make it possible to install.</p>
<h3 id="load-keymaps">Load Keymaps</h3>
<p>A keymap is how your keyboard is laid out. It defines the keys you use and where they are placed on the keyboard. To find a list of all the keymaps available for your language/region, run the below command:</p>
<pre><code>localectl <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>-keymaps
</code></pre><p>To search for a keymap, use the following command, replacing <code>[search_term]</code> with the code for your language, country, or layout:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-string">localectl </span><span class="hljs-built_in">list-keymaps</span> | <span class="hljs-string">grep </span>-i [<span class="hljs-string">search_term]</span>
</code></pre><p>Once you&#39;ve found a keymap that matches your physical keyboard&#39;s layout, run the below command.</p>
<pre><code>loadkeys <span class="hljs-string">[keymap]</span>
</code></pre><h3 id="connect-to-the-internet-a-name-connect-to-internet-a-">Connect to the internet <a name="connect-to-internet"></a></h3>
<p>The ArchISO <em>requires</em> an internet connection in order to be set up properly.\
If your computer is connected via Ethernet, you may skip this section by going <a href="#test-connectivity">here</a>.\
If it isn&#39;t however, you must connect to the internet by reading the instructions below.</p>
<p>Check if your access point is either a Wi-Fi router or mobile broadband modem, of which the former is more likely.</p>
<details>
 <summary><h3>WiFi Router (iwctl)</h3></summary>

 If your access point is a Wi-Fi router, run the below command:
 <code>iwctl</code>
 This will bring up an interactive prompt session and change your prompt from:
 <code>root@archiso ~ #</code>
 to:
 <code>[iwd]#</code>

 If you don&#39;t know what your wireless device&#39;s name is, you can list them by running:
 <code>device list</code>
 To turn your wireless device and its corresponding adapter on, run the below commands:
 <code>device [device-name] set-property Powered on
 adapter [adapter-name] set-property Powered on</code>
 (replacing <code>[device-name]</code> with your device&#39;s name and <code>[adapter-name]</code> with its corresponding adapter&#39;s name respectively) 

 Then, to scan for Wi-Fi networks, run:
 <code>station [device-name] scan</code>
 To list them, run:
 <code>station [device-name] get-networks</code>
 Find your router&#39;s SSID amongst the list shown, and connect to it by running:
 <code>station [device-name] connect [your router&#39;s SSID]</code>
</details>

<details>
 <summary><h3>Mobile Broadband Modem (mmcli)</h3></summary>

 Start and enable <code>ModemManager.service</code>, this is the service that allows you to connect to your Mobile Broadband Modem.\
 You can do so by running:
 <code>systemctl start ModemManager.service
 systemctl enable ModemManager.service</code>
 You can find a list of modems nearby you by running:
 <code>mmcli -L</code>
 Look for <code>/org/freedesktop/ModemManager1/Modem/[modem index]</code>
 (where your modem index is a unique number representing your modem)

 Connect to your modem by running:
 <code>mmcli -m [modem index] --simple-connect=&quot;apn=[your modem&#39;s APN]&quot;</code>

 Your APN is your modem&#39;s Access Point Name and will have been given to you by your ISP.
 If your modem requires a username and password, you can specify them like so:
 <code>mmcli -m [modem index] --simple-connect=&quot;apn=[your modem&#39;s APN],user=[username],password=[password]&quot;</code>

</details>

<h4 id="testing-your-internet-connection-a-name-test-connectivity-a-">Testing your internet connection <a name="test-connectivity"></a></h4>
<p><code>ping</code> is a command that sends data to a URL and checks that the data has been sent properly. This is normally done to test the URL or to test your internet connection, of which you are doing the latter.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">ping</span> -c <span class="hljs-number">4</span> archlinux<span class="hljs-meta">.org</span>
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>The <code>-c</code> switch represents the amount of sample data you are sending to that URL, in this case, 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="check-the-system-clock-is-correct">Check the system clock is correct</h3>
<p>Your computer keeps track of time by utilising an internal hardware clock.\
To check that it&#39;s in sync with the real world time, run the below command:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">timedatectl</span>
</code></pre><p>If <code>NTP service</code> does not show <code>active</code>, run the below command:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-string">timedatectl </span><span class="hljs-built_in">set-ntp</span> <span class="hljs-string">true</span>
</code></pre><p>As of now, you don&#39;t have to worry about the timezone, just make sure that the UTC time it returns matches real-world UTC time</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="creating-necessary-partitions-a-name-partition-disk-a-">Creating necessary partitions <a name="partition-disk"></a></h2>
<p>:warning: - Make sure that all of your data on the disk you want to install Arch Linux onto has been backed up. If you&#39;ve already done that or you don&#39;t care about the data present on it, proceed with this guide. If not, exit out the ArchISO and back up your data.</p>
<p>Run the below command:</p>
<pre><code>[ <span class="hljs-_">-d</span> /sys/firmware/efi ] &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> UEFI || <span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> BIOS
</code></pre><p>And take note of whether it returns <code>UEFI</code> or <code>BIOS</code></p>
<h3 id="disk-partitioning">Disk Partitioning</h3>
<details>
 <summary><h3>UEFI</h3></summary>

Run the below commands to initialise the disk:
<code>gdisk /dev/sdx</code>
&gt; (where sdx refers to the letter of your drive)

The above will open up an interactive prompt session and change the prompt from:
<code>root@archiso ~ #</code>
to:
<code>Command (? for help):</code>

Run:
<code>x</code>

which will change your prompt to:
<code>Expert command (? for help):</code>

And enter:
<code>z</code>
To &quot;zap&quot; the disk (basically, to initialise the disk).\
It will ask you if you want to confirm, enter <code>y</code> and it will then if ask you want to &quot;blank out MBR?&quot;, which means it will wipe all of the boot code and other critical data necessary for an OS to boot. Since you&#39;re no longer booting from your old OS, go ahead and hit <code>y</code>.

Run gdisk again and enter the below character, as gdisk only uses one-character commands (do not type <code>=</code> or anything after <code>=</code>, as those are just explanations for what each command does):

 <code>n = New Partition
[simply press enter] = 1st Partition
[simply press enter] = As First Sector
+1G = As Last sector (BOOT Partition Size)
ef00 = EFI Partition Type

n = New Partition
[simply press enter] = 2nd Partition
[simply press enter] = As First Sector
+16G = As Last sector (SWAP size, or double your RAM, whichever is smaller)
8200 = Linux Swap</code>

If you want to create a home partition (separates the data that is your system from your basic user apps and configurations), enter the below:

<code>n = New Partition
[simply press enter] = 3rd Partition
[simply press enter] = As First Sector
+40G = As Last sector [ROOT Partition Size (you may use 20GiB if you have a small hard drive)]
[simply press enter] = Linux filesystem

n = New Parition
[simply press enter] = 4th Partition
[simply press enter] = As first sector
[simply press enter] = As last sector [HOME parition size (takes up remaining hard drive space)]
[simply press enter] = Linux filesystem

w = Write partitions and quit</code>

If you don&#39;t want to do that, however, enter the below:
<code>n = New Parition
[simply press enter] = 3rd Partition
[simply press enter] = As first sector
[simply press enter] = As last sector [ROOT parition size (takes up remaining hard drive space)]
[simply press enter] = Linux filesystem

w = Write partitions and quit</code>
<details>
 <summary><h4>Encrypt your drive (optional)</h4></summary>
LUKS encryption encrypts your root partition (and home partition too, if present) so that attackers who have physical access to your laptop cannot access the contents of your drive.

To set that up, enter the following commands:

<code>cryptsetup -v luksFormat /dev/sdx3</code>

And if you have set up a home partition, encrypt that too.

<code>cryptsetup -v luksFormat /dev/sdx4</code>

Make sure to unlock them so that they can be formatted later.

<code>cryptsetup open /dev/sdx3 root</code>

And if you have a separate home partition, run the below command:
<code>cryptsetup open /dev/sdx4 home</code>

</code></pre><p></details></p>
<details>
 <summary><h3>MBR</h3></summary>

To initialise the disk you want to install Arch on (&quot;sdx&quot; from now on), run the below command:
<code>sfdisk --delete /dev/sdx</code>

Then, enter the below (do not type anything where <code>=</code> precedes it, as those are just explanations for what each command does):
<code>n = New Partition
1 = Partition number, MBR only supports 4 partitions
[simply press enter] = First sector size
+16G = (or double the size of your RAM, whichever is smaller, this is your SWAP size)

t = Change partition type ID
19 = Linux SWAP</code>

If you want to create a home partition (separates the data that is your system from your basic user apps and configurations), enter the below:

<code>n = New Partition
2 = Partition number, MBR only supports 4 partitions
[simply press enter] = First sector size
+20G = (this is your ROOT size)

n = New Partition
3 = Partition number, MBR only supports 4 partitions
[simply press enter] = First sector size
[simply press enter] = (this is your HOME size, takes up the rest of the disk)

x = Enter expert mode
A = Make a partition bootable
2 = Make your ROOT partition bootable

w = Write partitions and quit</code>

Else, just enter the below:

<code>n = New Partition
2 = Partition number, MBR only supports 4 partitions
[simply press enter] = First sector size
[simply press enter] = (this is your ROOT size, takes up the rest of the disk)

x = Enter expert mode
A = Make a partition bootable
2 = Make your ROOT partition bootable

w = Write partitions and quit</code>

### Format non-swap partitions
<code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdx2
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdx3 # If you made a home partition</code>

Format and turn on swap memory
<code>mkswap /dev/sdx1
swapon /dev/sdx1</code>

### Mount Remaining Partitions
<code>mount /dev/sdx2 /mnt 
mount -m /dev/sdx3 /mnt/home</code>

</code></pre><p>A mirror is basically a repository of files located within a specific region so that people near that region can download files with minimal ping (as ping is how long it takes for the data you requested for reaches you).\
A mirrorlist is a list of these mirrors ranked based on their speed relative to your computer.\
The <code>-c</code> flag allows you to specify which country you live in, this is to reduce ping.\
The <code>-a</code> flag excludes mirrors that haven&#39;t been updated within the hour range specifies (in this case, 12 hours)\
The <code>-p</code> flag specifies the protocol you want to download packages through. HTTPS is chosen here as it is the fastest and the safest.\
<code>--sort</code> sorts the mirrors by how fast they are, relative to your computer.\
<code>--save</code> specifies to reflector to save them in <code>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</code>, which is where pacman refers to when you want to download a package.</p>

<code>base-devel</code> is software for development purposes only, such as GCC or G++.\
<code>linux</code>, <code>linux-headers</code> and <code>linux-firmware</code> are the kernel, which, together, act as the middleman between the software on your computer and the hardware on your computer.\
<code>mtools</code> allows the user to access MS-DOS disks.\
<code>dosfstools</code> allows the user to format MS-DOS disks.\
<code>networkmanager</code> allows the user to connect to the internet.\</p>

<li>Replace <code>intel-ucode</code> with <code>amd-ucode</code> if you are using an AMD Processor.</li>
<li>If you want to include a derivative of the Linux kernel (e.g. linux-zen, linux-hardened, linux-lts), include that ALONGSIDE the original kernel and headers so if something breaks, you always have that extra option to use the regular Linux kernel. This can be done by appending your chosen Linux derivative (e.g. <code>linux-zen</code>) and its headers (e.g. <code>linux-zen-headers</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generate-fstab-a-name-genfstab-a-">Generate fstab <a name="genfstab"></a></h3>
<p>The fstab file lists all available disk partitions and other types of file systems and data sources that may not necessarily be disk-based, and indicates how they are to be initialized or otherwise integrated into the larger file system structure. It is <em>essential</em> for your system to function.</p>
<pre><code>genfstab -U <span class="hljs-regexp">/mnt &gt;&gt; /m</span>nt<span class="hljs-regexp">/etc/</span>fstab

<p>The bootloader is what manages the boot process, and is the PID 0 of your Arch system.\
If you&#39;re on an MBR systems, install GRUB and if you&#39;re on an EFI system, install SystemD-Boot.\
You need to do some extra steps before installing the bootloader if you&#39;ve encrypted your ROOT/HOME parition(s).</p>
<p>You&#39;ll still need to install a bootloader if you&#39;ve set up LUKS. Go to &quot;Installing and configuring SystemD-Boot&quot; below. </p>

<details>
 <summary><h3>Installing GRUB (MBR)</h3></summary>
&quot;Targets&quot; are CPU architechtures. These are important for grub to know so it can handle the boot proess correctly.\
Find your CPU architechture from <a href="https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/Linux/shell/commands/grub-install#grub-install-target">this site</a> and specify that as the target.

<code>pacman -S grub
grub-install /dev/[disk name] # You don&#39;t need to specify a target because the default is i386-pc
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>

<details>
 <summary><h4>If you&#39;ve set up LUKS encryption on your hard drive</h4></summary>

Because you&#39;ve encrypted your ROOT (and HOME partition, if present), you need to perform some extra steps.

Open and edit your <code>/etc/mkinitcpio.conf</code> file:
<code>sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf</code>

Find the below line:
<code>HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf block filesystems keyboard fsck)</code>

And change it to:
<code>HOOKS=(base udev autodetect keyboard keymap modconf block encrypt filesystems keyboard fsck)</code>

Save and exit, then recreate the initramfs image by running:
<code>mkinitcpio -P</code>

 <summary><h4>Enable secure boot (Optional)<a name="enable-secure-boot"></a></h4></summary>

Secure Boot is a security standard designed to ensure that a device boots using only trusted software. To enable it, go into your firmware settings and erase all of your secure boot keys. The way on how to do so differs between manufacturers.\
Once you&#39;ve done that, install sbctl by running the below command:

<code>sudo pacman -S sbctl</code>

Then create secure boot keys by running the below command:
<code>sudo sbctl create-keys</code>

Then enroll those keys, alongside Microsoft&#39;s, to the UEFI
<code>sudo enroll-keys -m</code>

Check what files need to be signed by running:
<code>sbctl verify</code>

And sign those files:
<code>sbctl sign -s /boot/vmlinuz-linux
sbctl sign -s /boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI</code>

If you have any Linux derivatives installed, go ahead and sign those too.

<p>Doing this is common sense, as many greeters do not include the root account as one of the users when logging it.\
To do this, run the below:</p>
<pre><code>useradd -mG wheel <span class="hljs-string">[username]</span>
</code></pre><p>replacing <code>[username]</code> with the username of your choice.
The <code>-m</code> option creates a user directory for you, where local configurations and apps are stored.
The <code>-G wheel</code> option creates the user as part of the wheel group, which will allow you to make changes on the system itself. For example, downloading and installing packages, and configuring them.</p>
<p>Set a password for the user account by running:</p>
<pre><code>passwd <span class="hljs-string">[username]</span>
</code></pre><p>Repeat the above process as many times as you want, depending on the amount of users you want to add to your system.\

<p>Firstly, to take a look at what network stations you have installed on your computer, use the command:</p>
